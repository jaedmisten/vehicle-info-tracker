12/17/21 - Created laravel 8 project.

12/18/21 - Started setting up authentication. Did not want to use Laravel 8 way of
auth scaffolding because it uses Tailwind CSS. Previous version of Laravel used
Laravel UI, but that is or will be deprecated.
Installed Fortify to do backend authentication. Ran database migrations to create authentication
tables. Copied view for registration from Laravel UI.

Using steps for Fortify for backend authentication and copying views from Laravel UI from
these youtube videos:

Currently register is working.


12/20/21 - Setup login with Fortify. Copied view from Laravel UI for login page.
Created basic home URI that requires being logged into to access.


12/21/21 - Created database migrations, models, and controllers for vehicles, notes, and engines.
Vehicles has foreign key to users table. Notes and engines tables have foreign keys to users table.


12/22/21 - Updated migration for vehicles table to have columns for license plate number, color,
currently own (bool), and purchase date. Also, changed year column to use year data type instead
of tinyint.


12/23/21 - Added basic pages to display all vehicles ('/vehicle') for a user and details for 
a specific vehicle ('/vehicles/{id}');
